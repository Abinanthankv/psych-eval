DASS-21 Scoring Instructions
The DASS-21 should not be used to replace a face to face clinical interview. If you are experiencing significant
emotional difficulties you should contact your GP for a referral to a qualified professional.
Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21)
The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) is a set of three self-report scales designed to
measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress.
Each of the three DASS-21 scales contains 7 items, divided into subscales with similar content. The depression
scale assesses dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest / involvement,
anhedonia and inertia. The anxiety scale assesses autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational
anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect. The stress scale is sensitive to levels of chronic nonspecific arousal. It assesses difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, and being easily upset / agitated, irritable /
over-reactive and impatient. Scores for depression, anxiety and stress are calculated by summing the scores
for the relevant items.
The DASS-21 is based on a dimensional rather than a categorical conception of psychological disorder. The
assumption on which the DASS-21 development was based (and which was confirmed by the research data) is
that the differences between the depression, anxiety and the stress experienced by normal subjects and
clinical populations are essentially differences of degree. The DASS-21 therefore has no direct implications for
the allocation of patients to discrete diagnostic categories postulated in classificatory systems such as the
DSM and ICD.
Recommended cut-off scores for conventional severity labels (normal, moderate, severe) are as follows:

NB Scores on the DASS-21 will need to be multiplied by 2 to calculate the final score.

Versions
Commentary
The HAM-A was one of the first rating scales developed
to measure the severity of anxiety symptoms, and is still
widely used today in both clinical and research settings.
The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of
symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental
agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety
(physical complaints related to anxiety). Although the
HAM-A remains widely used as an outcome measure in
clinical trials, it has been criticized for its sometimes poor
ability to discriminate between anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, and somatic anxiety versus somatic side
effects. The HAM-A does not provide any standardized
probe questions. Despite this, the reported levels of interrater reliability for the scale appear to be acceptable.

The scale has been translated into: Cantonese for China,
French and Spanish. An IVR version of the scale is available from Healthcare Technology Systems.

HAMILTON DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (HAM-D)
Instructions for the Clinician:
The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) has proven useful for many years as
a way of determining a patient’s level of depression before, during, and after treatment.
It should be administered by a clinician experienced in working with psychiatric
patients .
Although the HAM-D form lists 21 items, the scoring is based on the first 17. It
generally takes 15-20 minutes to complete the interview and score the results. Eight
items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe. Nine
are scored from 0-2.
Since its development in 1960 by Dr. Max.Hamilton of the University of Leeds,
England, the scale has been widely used in clinical practice and become a standard in
pharmaceutical trials.

HAM-D Scoring Instructions:
Sum the scores from the first 17 items.
0-7

= Normal

8-13 = Mild Depression
14-18 = Moderate Depression
19-22 = Severe Depression
≥ 23 = Very Severe Depression

INTERPRETING THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY
Now that you have completed the questionnaire, add up the score for each of the twenty-one
questions by counting the number to the right of each question you marked. The highest possible
total for the whole test would be sixty-three. This would mean you circled number three on all
twenty-one questions. Since the lowest possible score for each question is zero, the lowest
possible score for the test would be zero. This would mean you circles zero on each question.
You can evaluate your depression according to the Table below.
Total Score____________________Levels of Depression
1-10____________________These ups and downs are considered normal
11-16___________________ Mild mood disturbance
17-20___________________Borderline clinical depression
21-30___________________Moderate depression
31-40___________________Severe depression
over 40__________________Extreme depression

YMRS- Total score- 60,

SCORE

SCORE

10. HOSTILITY
Animosity, contempt, belligerence, disdain for other people
outside the interview situation. Rate solely on the basis of
the verbal report of feelings and actions of the patient
toward others; do not infer hostility from neurotic defenses,

have had in the past, malicious or discriminatory intent
toward the patient. On the basis of verbal report, rate only
those suspicions which are currently held whether they

integration of the verbal products of the patient; do not rate
on the basis of patient’s subjective impression of his own
level of functioning.

Rate on the basis of observed behavior of the patient only;
do not rate on the basis of patient’s subjective impression
of own energy level.

SCORE

POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE (PANSS) RATING CRITERIA
GENERAL RATING INSTRUCTIONS
Data gathered from this assessment procedure are applied to the PANSS
ratings. Each of the 30 items is accompanied by a specific definition as well
as detailed anchoring criteria for all seven rating points. These seven points
represent increasing levels of psychopathology, as follows:
1- absent
2- minimal
3- mild
4- moderate
5- moderate severe
6- severe
7- extreme
In assigning ratings, one first considers whether an item is at all present, as
judging by its definition. If the item is absent, it is scored 1, whereas if it is
present one must determine its severity by reference to the particular criteria
from the anchoring points. The highest applicable rating point is always
assigned, even if the patient meets criteria for lower points as well. In
judging the level of severity, the rater must utilise a holistic perspective in
deciding which anchoring point best characterises the patient’s functioning
and rate accordingly, whether or not all elements of the description are
observed.
The rating points of 2 to 7 correspond to incremental levels of symptom
severity:
•

A rating of 2 (minimal) denotes questionable or subtle or suspected
pathology, or it also may allude to the extreme end of the normal
range.

•

A rating of 3 (mild) is indicative of a symptom whose presence is
clearly established but not pronounced and interferes little in day-today functioning.

•

A rating of 4 (moderate) characterises a symptom which, though
representing a serious problem, either occurs only occasionally or
intrudes on daily life only to a moderate extent.

•

A rating of 5 (moderate severe) indicates marked manifestations that
distinctly impact on one’s functioning but are not all-consuming and
usually can be contained at will.

•

A rating of 6 (severe) represents gross pathology that is present very
frequently, proves highly disruptive to one’s life, and often calls for
direct supervision.

•

A rating of 7 (extreme) refers to the most serious level of
psychopathology, whereby the manifestations drastically interfere in
most or all major life functions, typically necessitating close
supervision and assistance in many areas.

Each item is rated in consultation with the definitions and criteria provided in
this manual. The ratings are rendered on the PANSS rating form overleaf by
encircling the appropriate number following each dimension.

SCORING INSTRUCTIONS
Of the 30 items included in the PANSS, 7 constitute a Positive Scale, 7 a
Negative Scale, and the remaining 16 a General Psychopathology Scale.
The scores for these scales are arrived at by summation of ratings across
component items. Therefore, the potential ranges are 7 to 49 for the Positive
and Negative Scales, and 16 to 112 for the General Psychopathology Scale.
In addition to these measures, a Composite Scale is scored by subtracting
the negative score from the positive score. This yields a bipolar index that
ranges from –42 to +42, which is essentially a difference score reflecting the
degree of predominance of one syndrome in relation to the other.

Absent - Definition does not apply
Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
Mild - Presence of one or two delusions which are vague, uncrystallised and not
tenaciously held. Delusions do not interfere with thinking, social relations or behaviour.
Moderate - Presence of either a kaleidoscopic array of poorly formed, unstable delusions or a
few well-formed delusions that occasionally interfere with thinking, social relations or behaviour.
Moderate Severe - Presence of numerous well-formed delusions that are tenaciously held
and occasionally interfere with thinking, social relations and behaviour.
Severe - Presence of a stable set of delusions which are crystallised, possibly systematised,
tenaciously held and clearly interfere with thinking, social relations and behaviour.
Extreme - Presence of a stable set of delusions which are either highly systematised or very
numerous, and which dominate major facets of the patient’s life. This frequently results in
inappropriate and irresponsible action, which may even jeopardise the safety of the patient or others.

Absent - Definition does not apply
Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
Mild - Thinking is circumstantial, tangential or paralogical. There is some difficulty in directing
thoughts towards a goal, and some loosening of associations may be evidenced under pressure.
Moderate - Able to focus thoughts when communications are brief and structured, but becomes
loose or irrelevant when dealing with more complex communications or when under minimal pressure.
Moderate Severe - Generally has difficulty in organising thoughts, as evidenced by frequent
irrelevancies, disconnectedness or loosening of associations even when not under pressure.
Severe - Thinking is seriously derailed and internally inconsistent, resulting in gross
irrelevancies and disruption of thought processes, which occur almost constantly.
Extreme - Thoughts are disrupted to the point where the patient is incoherent. There is marked
loosening of associations, which result in total failure of communication, e.g. “word salad” or mutism.

HALLUCINATORY BEHAVIOUR - Verbal report or behaviour indicating perceptions which are
not generated by external stimuli. These may occur in the auditory, visual, olfactory or somatic realms.
Basis for rating - Verbal report and physical manifestations during the course of
interview as well as reports of behaviour by primary care workers or family.

Absent - Definition does not apply
Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
Mild - One or two clearly formed but infrequent hallucinations, or else a number of vague
abnormal perceptions which do not result in distortions of thinking or behaviour.
Moderate - Hallucinations occur frequently but not continuously, and the patient’s
thinking and behaviour are only affected to a minor extent.
Moderate Severe - Hallucinations occur frequently, may involve more than one sensory modality,
and tend to distort thinking and/or disrupt behaviour. Patient may have a delusional interpretation of
these experiences and respond to them emotionally and, on occasion, verbally as well.
Severe - Hallucinations are present almost continuously, causing major disruption of
thinking and behaviour. Patient treats these as real perceptions, and functioning is impeded
by frequent emotional and verbal responses to them.
Extreme - Patient is almost totally preoccupied with hallucinations, which virtually dominate
thinking and behaviour. Hallucinations are provided a rigid delusional interpretation and
provoke verbal and behavioural responses, including obedience to command hallucinations.

Moderate Severe - Significant hyperactivity or frequent outbursts of motor activity are observed,
making it difficult for the patient to sit still for longer than several minutes at any given time.
Severe - Marked excitement dominates the interview, delimits attention, and to some
extent affects personal functions such as eating or sleeping.
Extreme - marked excitement seriously interferes in eating and sleeping and makes
interpersonal interactions virtually impossible. Acceleration of speech and motor activity
may result in incoherence and exhaustion.

Absent - Definition does not apply
Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
Mild - Some expansiveness or boastfulness is evident, but without clear-cut grandiose
delusions.

persecutory delusions, but these do not seem to affect the patient’s attitude or interpersonal relations.
Moderate Severe - Patient shows marked distrustfulness, leading to major disruption of
interpersonal relations, or else there are clear-cut persecutory delusions that have limited
impact on interpersonal relations and behaviour.
Severe - Clear-cut pervasive delusions of persecution which may be systematised and
significantly interfere in interpersonal relations.

Mild - General orientation is adequate but there is some difficulty with specifics. For example, patient
knows his location but not the street address, knows hospital staff names but not their functions, knows
the month but confuses the day of the week with an adjacent day, or errs in the date by more than two
days. There may be narrowing of interest evidenced by familiarity with the immediate but not extended
milieu, such as ability to identify staff but not the mayor, governor, or president.
Moderate - Only partial success in recognising persons, places and time. For example, patient knows he is in a
hospital but not its name, knows the name of the city but not the borough or district, knows the name of his
primary therapist but not many other direct care workers, knows the year or season but not sure of the month.

due to marked distraction by internal or external stimuli.
Extreme - Attention is so disrupted that even brief conversation is not possible.

G12. LACK OF JUDGEMENT AND INSIGHT - Impaired awareness or understanding of one’s own
psychiatric condition and life situation. This is evidenced by failure to recognise past or present
psychiatric illness or symptoms, denial of need for psychiatric hospitalisation or treatment, decisions
characterised by poor anticipation or consequences, and unrealistic short-term and long-range planning.

Mild - Recognises having a psychiatric disorder but clearly underestimates its seriousness, the implications for
treatment, or the importance of taking measures to avoid relapse. Future planning may be poorly conceived.
Moderate - Patient shows only a vague or shallow recognition of illness. There may be fluctuations in
acknowledgement of being ill or little awareness of major symptoms which are present, such as
delusions, disorganised thinking, suspiciousness and social withdrawal. The patient may rationalise the
need for treatment in terms of its relieving lesser symptoms, such as anxiety, tension and sleep difficulty.
Moderate Severe - Acknowledges past but not present psychiatric disorder. If challenged, the patient
may concede the presence of some unrelated or insignificant symptoms, which tend to be explained away by
gross misinterpretation or delusional thinking. The need for psychiatric treatment similarly goes unrecognised.
Severe - Patient denies ever having had a psychiatric disorder. He disavows the presence of any psychiatric
symptoms in the past or present and, though compliant, denies the need for treatment and hospitalisation.
Extreme - Emphatic denial of past and present psychiatric illness. Current hospitalisation and treatment
are given a delusional interpretation (e.g. as punishment fro misdeeds, as persecution by tormentors, etc),
and the patient thus refuse to cooperate with therapists, medication or other aspects of treatment.

G13. DISTURBANCE OF VOLITION – Disturbance in the wilful initiation, sustenance and
control of one’s thoughts, behaviour, movements and speech.
Basis for rating - Thought content and behaviour manifested in the course of interview.

Absent - Definition does not apply
Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
Mild - There is evidence of some indecisiveness in conversation and thinking, which may
impede verbal and cognitive processes to a minor extent.
Moderate - Patient is often ambivalent and shows clear difficulty in reaching decisions.
Conversation may be marred by alteration in thinking, and in consequence, verbal and
cognitive functioning are clearly impaired.
Moderate Severe - Disturbance of volition interferes in thinking as well as behaviour.
Patient shows pronounced indecision that impedes the initiation and continuation of social
and motor activities, and which also may be evidence in halting speech.
Severe - Disturbance of volition interferes in the execution of simple automatic motor
functions, such as dressing or grooming, and markedly affects speech.
Extreme – Almost complete failure of volition is manifested by gross inhibition of movement
and speech resulting in immobility and/or mutism.

G14. POOR IMPULSE CONTROL - Disordered regulation and control of action on inner urges, resulting in sudden,
unmodulated, arbitrary or misdirected discharge of tension and emotions without concern about consequences.
Basis for rating – Behaviour during the course of interview and reported by primary
care workers or family.

G16.

Absent - Definition does not apply
Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
Mild - Patient tends to be easily angered and frustrated when facing stress or denied
gratification but rarely acts on impulse.
Moderate - Patient gets angered and verbally abusive with minimal provocation. May be occasionally
threatening, destructive, or have one or two episodes involving physical confrontation or a minor brawl.
Moderate Severe - Patient exhibits repeated impulsive episodes involving verbal abuse,
destruction of property, or physical threats. There may be one or two episodes involving
serious assault, for which the patient requires isolation, physical restraint, or p.r.n. sedation.
Severe - Patient frequently is impulsive aggressive, threatening, demanding, and destructive,
without any apparent consideration of consequences. Shows assualtive behaviour and may
also be sexually offensive and possibly respond behaviourally to hallucinatory commands.
Extreme - Patient exhibits homicidal, sexual assaults, repeated brutality, or self-destructive behaviour. Requires
constant direct supervision or external constraints because of inability to control dangerous impulses.

Absent - Definition does not apply
Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
Mild - Excessive involvement with personal needs or problems, such that conversation
veers back to egocentric themes and there is diminished concerned exhibited toward others.
Moderate - Patient occasionally appears self-absorbed, as if daydreaming or involved with
internal experiences, which interferes with communication to a minor extent.
Moderate Severe - Patient often appears to be engaged in autistic experiences, as evidenced by
behaviours that significantly intrude on social and communicational functions, such as the presence
of a vacant stare, muttering or talking to oneself, or involvement with stereotyped motor patterns.
Severe - Marked preoccupation with autistic experiences, which seriously delimits
concentration, ability to converse, and orientation to the milieu. The patient frequently may
be observed smiling, laughing, muttering, talking, or shouting to himself.
Extreme - Gross absorption with autistic experiences, which profoundly affects all major
realms of behaviour. The patient constantly may be responding verbally or behaviourally to
hallucinations and show little awareness of other people or the external milieu.

ACTIVE SOCIAL AVOIDANCE - Diminished social involvement associated with
unwarranted fear, hostility, or distrust.
Basis for rating - Reports of social functioning primary care workers or family.

Absent - Definition does not apply
Minimal - Questionable pathology; may be at the upper extreme of normal limits
Mild - Patient seems ill at ease in the presence of others of others and prefers to spend
time alone, although he participates in social functions when required.
Moderate - Patient begrudgingly attends all or most social activities but may needs to be
persuaded or may terminate prematurely on account of anxiety, suspiciousness, or hostility.
Moderate Severe - Patient fearfully or angrily keeps away from many social interactions
despite others’ efforts to engage him. Tends to spend unstructured time alone.
Severe - Patient participates in very few social activities because of fear, hostility, or distrust. When approached, the
patient shows a strong tendency to break off interactions, and generally he tends to isolate himself from others.
Extreme - Patient cannot be engaged in social activities because of pronounced fears, hostility, or
persecutory delusions. To the extent possible, he avoids all interactions and remains isolated from others.

Appendix I - Standardized examination for catatonia. The method described here is used to
complete the 23-item Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (CRS) and the 14-item Catatonia
Screening Instrument (CSI). Item definitions on the two scales are the same. The CRS measures the
severity of 23 signs on a 0- 3 scale, while the CSI measures only the presence or absence of the first
14 signs.
Ratings are to be made solely on the basis of observed behaviour during the examination with the
exception of completion of the items for 'withdrawal' and autonomic abnormality', which may be
based on directly observed behaviour and for chart documentation. As a general rule, only rate
items which are clearly present. If uncertain as to the presence of an item, rate the item as '0'.

Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)
Instructions: Patient should be observed while they are seated, and then standing while engaged in neutral
conversation (for a minimum of two minutes in each position). Symptoms observed in other situations, for
example while engaged in activity on the ward, may also be rated. Subsequently, the subjective phenomena
should be elicited by direct questioning.

Absent. No evidence of awareness of restlessness. Observation of characteristic movements of
akathisia in the absence of a subjective report of inner restlessness or compulsive desire to move the
legs should be classified as pseudoakathisia
Questionable. Non-specific inner tension and fidgety movements
Mild akathisia. Awareness of restlessness in the legs and/or inner restlessness worse when required to
stand still. Fidgety movements present, but characteristic restless movements of akathisia not
necessarily observed. Condition causes little or no distress.
Moderate akathisia. Awareness of restlessness as described for mild akathisia above, combined with
characteristic restless movements such as rocking from foot to foot when standing. Patient finds the
condition distressing
Marked akathisia. Subjective experience of restlessness includes a compulsive desire to walk or pace.
However, the patient is able to remain seated for at least five minutes. The condition is obviously
distressing.
Severe akathisia. The patient reports a strong compulsion to pace up and down most of the time.
Unable to sit or lie down for more than a few minutes. Constant restlessness which is associated with
intense distress and insomnia.

Scoring the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)
The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale is scored as follows:
Objective Akathisia, Subjective Awareness of Restlessness and Subjective Distress
Related to Restlessness are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 – 3 and are summed
yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 9.
The Global Clinical Assessment of Akathisia uses a 5-point scale ranging from 0 – 4.

MODIFIED SIMPSON-ANGUS SCALE (MSAS)
Extrapyramidal Side Effects Scale
Each item is rated on a 5-point scale of severity (0 = normal; 4 = most severe; NR = not rated). Circle the rating that
best describes the subject’s present condition (3 is upper limit for patients without EPS).
1. Gait: The patient is examined as he walks into the
examining room: his gait, the swing of his arms, his general
posture all form the basis for an overall score for this item.
This is rated as follows:
0 = Normal
1 = Diminution in swing while the subject is walking
2 = Marked diminution in swing with obvious rigidity in
the arm
3 = Stiff gait with arms held rigidly before the abdomen
4 = Stooped, shuffling gait with propulsion and
retropulsion
NR = Not ratable
2. Arm Dropping: The patient and the examiner both raise
their arms to shoulder height and let them fall to their sides.
In a normal subject, a stout slap is heard as the arms hit the
sides. In the patient with extreme Parkinson’s Syndrome,
the arms fall very slowly.
0 = Normal, free fall with loud slap and rebound
1 = Fall slowed slightly with less audible contact and little
rebound
2 = Fall slowed, no rebound
3 = Marked slowing, no slap at all
4 = Arms fall as though against resistance, as though
through glue
NR = Not ratable
3. Shoulder Shaking: The subject’s arms are bent at a
right angle at the elbow and are taken one at a time by the
examiner, who also grasps one hand and also clasps the
other around the subject’s elbow. The subject’s upper arm
is pushed to and fro, and the humerus is externally rotated.
The degree of resistance from normal to extreme rigidity is
scored as follows:
0 = Normal
1 = Slight stiffness and resistance
2 = Moderate stiffness and resistance
3 = Marked rigidity with difficulty in passive movement
4 = Extreme stiffness and rigidity with almost a frozen joint
NR = Not ratable

0 = Normal
1 = Slight stiffness and resistance
2 = Moderate stiffness and resistance
3 = Marked rigidity with difficulty in passive movement
4 = Extreme stiffness and rigidity with almost a frozen joint
NR= Not ratable
5. Wrist Rigidity or Fixation of Position: The wrist is
held in one hand and the fingers held by the examiner’s
other hand, with the wrist moved to extension, flexion, and
ulnar and radial deviation, or the extended wrist is allowed
to fall under its own weight, or the arm can be grasped
above the wrist and shaken to and fro. A “1” score would
be a hand that extends easily, falls loosely, or flaps easily
upwards and downwards.
0 = Normal
1 = Slight stiffness and resistance
2 = Moderate stiffness and resistance
3 = Marked rigidity with difficulty in passive movement
4 = Extreme stiffness and rigidity with almost a frozen joint
NR = Not ratable
6. Head Rotation: The subject sits or stands and is told
that the examiner will move his head from side to side, that
it will not hurt, and that he should try and relax. (Questions
about pain in the cervical area or difficulty in moving his
head should be obtained to avoid causing any pain.) Clasp
the subject’s head between the two hands with the fingers
on the back of the neck. Gently rotate the head in a circular
motion 3 times and evaluate the muscular resistance to this
movement.
0 = Loose, no resistance
1 = Slight resistance to movement
2 = Resistance is apparent and the time of rotation is
shortened
3 = Resistance is obvious and rotation is slowed
4 = Head appears stiff and rotation is difficult to carry out
NR = Not ratable

4. Elbow Rigidity: The elbow joints are separately bent at
right angles and passively extended and flexed, with the
subject’s biceps observed and simultaneously palpated. The
resistance to this procedure is rated. (The presence of
cogwheel rigidity is noted overall but not rated as a
separate item.)

Patient Name:_______________________________ Rater Name and Date: ______________________

7. Glabella Tap: The subject is told to open his eyes and
not to blink. The glabella region is tapped at a steady, rapid
speed. Note the number of times that the subject blinks in
succession. Take care to stand behind the subject so that he
does not observe the movement of the tapping finger. A full
blink need not be observed; there may be a contraction of
the infraorbital muscle producing a twitch each time a
stimulus is delivered. Vary the speed of tapping to assure
that the muscle contraction is related to the tap.
0 = 0 to 5 blinks
1 = 6 to 10 blinks
2 = 11 to 15 blinks
3 = 16 to 20 blinks
4 = 21 or more blinks
NR = Not ratable
8. Tremor: The subject is observed walking into the
examining room and then is re-examined for this item with
his arms extended at right angles to the body and the
fingers spread out as far as possible.
0 = Normal
1 = Mild finger tremor, obvious to sight and touch
2 = Tremor of hand or arm occurring spasmodically
3 = Persistent tremor of one or more limbs
4 = Whole body tremor
NR = Not ratable

9. Salivation: The subject is observed while talking and
then asked to open his mouth to elevate his tongue.
0 = Normal
1 = Excess salivation so that drooling takes place if mouth
is opened and tongue is raised
2 = Excess salivation is present and might occasionally
result in difficulty in speaking
3 = Speaking with difficulty because of excess drooling
4 = Frank drooling
NR = Not ratable
10. Akathisia: The subject is observed for restlessness. If
restlessness is noted, ask, “Do you feel restless or jittery
inside; is it difficult to sit still?” Subjective response is not
necessary for scoring, but subject report can help make the
assessment.
0 = No restlessness reported or observed
1 = Mild restlessness observed, e.g., occasional jiggling of
the foot occurs when the subject is seated
2 = Moderate restlessness observed, e.g., on several
occasions, the subject jiggles his foot, crosses and
uncrosses his legs, or twists a part of the body
3 = Restlessness is frequently observed, e.g., the subject’s
foot or legs are moving most of the time
4 = Restlessness persistently observed, e.g., the subject
cannot sit still, might get up and walk
NR = Not ratable

TOTAL SCORE:___________
Total Score Severity:
Less than 3 = normal
3 to 5 = minimal degree of movement disorder
6 to 11= clinically significant degree of movement disorder
12 to 17 = severe degree of movement disorder is present

Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) Symptom Checklist
Instructions
The questions on the back page are designed to stimulate dialogue between you and your patients and to help
confirm if they may be suffering from the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Description: The Symptom Checklist is an instrument consisting of the eighteen DSM-IV-TR criteria.
Six of the eighteen questions were found to be the most predictive of symptoms consistent with
ADHD. These six questions are the basis for the ASRS v1.1 Screener and are also Part A of the
Symptom Checklist. Part B of the Symptom Checklist contains the remaining twelve questions.
Instructions:
Symptoms
1. Ask the patient to complete both Part A and Part B of the Symptom Checklist by marking an X
in the box that most closely represents the frequency of occurrence of each of the symptoms.
2. Score Part A. If four or more marks appear in the darkly shaded boxes within Part A then the
patient has symptoms highly consistent with ADHD in adults and further investigation is
warranted.
3. The frequency scores on Part B provide additional cues and can serve as further probes into the
patient’s symptoms. Pay particular attention to marks appearing in the dark shaded boxes. The
frequency-based response is more sensitive with certain questions. No total score or diagnostic
likelihood is utilized for the twelve questions. It has been found that the six questions in Part A
are the most predictive of the disorder and are best for use as a screening instrument.
Impairments
1. Review the entire Symptom Checklist with your patients and evaluate the level of impairment
associated with the symptom.
2. Consider work/school, social and family settings.
3. Symptom frequency is often associated with symptom severity, therefore the Symptom
Checklist may also aid in the assessment of impairments. If your patients have frequent
symptoms, you may want to ask them to describe how these problems have affected the ability
to work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people such as their
spouse/significant other.
History
1. Assess the presence of these symptoms or similar symptoms in childhood. Adults who have
ADHD need not have been formally diagnosed in childhood. In evaluating a patient’s history,
look for evidence of early-appearing and long-standing problems with attention or self-control.
Some significant symptoms should have been present in childhood, but full symptomology is not
necessary.

The Value of Screening for Adults With ADHD

Research suggests that the symptoms of ADHD can persist into adulthood, having a significant
impact on the relationships, careers, and even the personal safety of your patients who may
suffer from it.1-4 Because this disorder is often misunderstood, many people who have it do not
receive appropriate treatment and, as a result, may never reach their full potential. Part of the
problem is that it can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in adults.
The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) Symptom Checklist was developed
in conjunction with the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Workgroup on Adult
ADHD that included the following team of psychiatrists and researchers:
•

Lenard Adler, MD
Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Neurology
New York University Medical School

•

Ronald C. Kessler, PhD
Professor, Department of Health Care Policy
Harvard Medical School

•

Thomas Spencer, MD
Associate Professor of Psychiatry
Harvard Medical School

As a healthcare professional, you can use the ASRS v1.1 as a tool to help screen for ADHD in
adult patients. Insights gained through this screening may suggest the need for a more in-depth
clinician interview. The questions in the ASRS v1.1 are consistent with DSM-IV criteria and
address the manifestations of ADHD symptoms in adults. Content of the questionnaire also
reflects the importance that DSM-IV places on symptoms, impairments, and history for a correct
diagnosis.4
The checklist takes about 5 minutes to complete and can provide information that is critical
to supplement the diagnostic process.

SDS: Interpretation of Scores
Originally developed for assessing psychological dependence on heroin, studies have
indicated that the SDS is a valuable tool for assessing psychological dependence on
other illicit drugs. The research to date, has suggested cut-offs for measuring
psychological dependence on various illicit drugs, as indicated below.

AUDIT

Introduction
The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is a 10-item
screening tool developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to
assess alcohol consumption, drinking behaviors, and alcohol-related
problems. Both a clinician-administered version (page 1) and a self-report
version of the AUDIT (page 2) are provided. Patients should be encouraged
to answer the AUDIT questions in terms of standard drinks. A chart
illustrating the approximate number of standard drinks in different alcohol
beverages is included for reference. A score of 8 or more is considered to
indicate hazardous or harmful alcohol use. The AUDIT has been validated
across genders and in a wide range of racial/ethnic groups and is wellsuited for use in primary care settings. Detailed guidelines about use of the
AUDIT have been published by the WHO and are available online:

NOTES ON THE USE OF THE SADQ
The Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire was developed by the Addiction
Research Unit at the Maudsley Hospital. It is a measure of the severity of
dependence. The AUDIT questionnaire, by contrast, is used to assess whether or not
there is a problem with dependence.
The SADQ questions cover the following aspects of dependency syndrome:
• physical withdrawal symptoms
• affective withdrawal symptoms
• relief drinking
• frequency of alcohol consumption
• speed of onset of withdrawal symptoms.
Scoring
Answers to each question are rated on a four-point scale:
Almost never - 0
Sometimes
1
Often
2
Nearly always 3
A score of 31 or higher indicates "severe alcohol dependence".
A score of 16 -30 indicates "moderate dependence"
A score of below 16 usually indicates only a mild physical dependency.
A chlordiazepoxide detoxification regime is usually indicated for someone who scores
16 or over.
It is essential to take account of the amount of alcohol that the patient reports drinking
prior to admission as well as the result of the SADQ.
There is no correlation between the SADQ and such parameters as the MCV or GGT.

Drug Abuse Screening Test, DAST-10
The following questions concern information about your possible involvement with drugs not including
alcoholic beverages during the past 12 months.
"Drug abuse" refers to (1) the use of prescribed or over‐the‐counter drugs in excess of the directions,
and (2) any nonmedical use of drugs.
The various classes of drugs may include cannabis (marijuana, hashish), solvents (e.g., paint thinner),
tranquilizers (e.g., Valium), barbiturates, cocaine, stimulants (e.g., speed), hallucinogens (e.g., LSD) or narcotics
(e.g., heroin). Remember that the questions do not include alcoholic beverages.

Please answer every question. If you have difficulty with a statement, then choose the response that is
mostly right.
In the past 12 months…

sensorium” which is rated on scale 0 to 4. Add up the scores for all ten criteria. This is the total CIWA-Ar score for the patient at that time.
Prophylactic medication should be started for any patient with a total CIWA-Ar score of 8 or greater (ie. start on withdrawal medication). If started on
scheduled medication, additional PRN medication should be given for a total CIWA-Ar score of 15 or greater.
Document vitals and CIWA-Ar assessment on the Withdrawal Assessment Sheet. Document administration of PRN medications on the assessment
sheet as well.
The CIWA-Ar scale is the most sensitive tool for assessment of the patient experiencing alcohol withdrawal. Nursing assessment is vitally important.
Early intervention for CIWA-Ar score of 8 or greater provides the best means to prevent the progression of withdrawal.

CAGE Substance Abuse Screening Tool
Directions: Ask your patients these four questions and use the scoring method described
below to determine if substance abuse exists and needs to be addressed.

CAGE Questions
1.
2.
3.
4.

Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking?
Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?
Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking?
Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or to
get rid of a hangover (eye-opener)?

CAGE Questions Adapted to Include Drug Use (CAGE-AID)
1.
2.
3.
4.

Have you ever felt you ought to cut down on your drinking or drug use?
Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking or drug use?
Have you felt bad or guilty about your drinking or drug use?
Have you ever had a drink or used drugs first thing in the morning to steady
your nerves or to get rid of a hangover (eye-opener)?

Scoring: Item responses on the CAGE questions are scored 0 for "no" and 1 for "yes"
answers, with a higher score being an indication of alcohol problems. A total score of
two or greater is considered clinically significant.
The normal cutoff for the CAGE is two positive answers, however, the Consensus Panel
recommends that the primary care clinicians lower the threshold to one positive answer
to cast a wider net and identify more patients who may have substance abuse disorders.
A number of other screening tools are available.
CAGE is derived from the four questions of the tool: Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, and Eye-opener

Clinical Opiate
Withdrawal Scale

Introduction
The Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) is an 11-item scale designed
to be administered by a clinician. This tool can be used in both inpatient
and outpatient settings to reproducibly rate common signs and symptoms
of opiate withdrawal and monitor these symptoms over time. The summed
score for the complete scale can be used to help clinicians determine the
stage or severity of opiate withdrawal and assess the level of physical
dependence on opioids. Practitioners sometimes express concern about
the objectivity of the items in the COWS; however, the symptoms of opioid
withdrawal have been likened to a severe influenza infection (e.g., nausea,
vomiting, sweating, joint aches, agitation, tremor), and patients should
not exceed the lowest score in most categories without exhibiting some
observable sign or symptom of withdrawal.

Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale

APPENDIX 1
Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale

For each item, circle the number that best describes the patient' s signs or symptom. Rate on j ust the
apparent relationship to opiate withdrawal. For example, if heart rate is increased because the patient
was jogging just prior to assessment, the increase pulse rate would not add to the score.
